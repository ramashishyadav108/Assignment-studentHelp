# User Database Sync Fix

## Problem
Users were signing in through Clerk but not being added to the database. The sign-up flow was redirecting directly to `/dashboard` instead of `/auth-callback` which syncs users.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated Environment Variables** (`.env`)
Changed redirect URLs to go through auth-callback:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL="/auth-callback"` (was `/dashboard`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL="/auth-callback"` (was `/dashboard`)

### 2. **Added Fallback Sync Component** (`UserSync.tsx`)
Created a client component that:
- Runs on every page load
- Automatically syncs the user if they're signed in but not in database
- Prevents duplicate syncs with a state flag
- Logs success/failure for debugging

### 3. **Integrated Sync in Layout** (`layout.tsx`)
Added `<UserSync />` component to root layout so it:
- Runs on every page
- Catches users who somehow bypass auth-callback
- Provides a safety net for database sync

## How It Works Now

### Sign-Up Flow:
1. User signs up via Clerk → `/sign-up`
2. Clerk redirects to → `/auth-callback`
3. Auth-callback calls → `/api/auth/sync` (creates user in DB)
4. Finally redirects to → `/dashboard`

### Sign-In Flow:
1. User signs in via Clerk → `/sign-in`
2. Clerk redirects to → `/auth-callback`
3. Auth-callback checks DB and creates user if missing
4. Finally redirects to → `/dashboard`

### Fallback Protection:
- If user somehow lands on any page without being synced
- `UserSync` component automatically calls `/api/auth/sync`
- User gets added to database

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Sign-Up
```bash
# Clear existing test users from database first
# Then:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/sign-up
2. Sign up with a new account
3. Watch console logs for "✅ User synced to database"
4. Check database - user should be present
```

### 2. Check Database
```sql
-- Connect to your database and run:
SELECT * FROM "User";
-- You should see users with:
-- - clerkId (from Clerk)
-- - email
-- - name (if provided)
-- - imageUrl (if provided)
```

### 3. Console Logs
Look for these logs:
- **Auth-callback**: "Setting up your account..."
- **Sync success**: "✅ User synced to database"
- **Sync failure**: "❌ Failed to sync user" or "❌ Error syncing user"

### 4. Test Existing Users
```bash
# Sign out
# Sign in with existing account
# Should see same sync process
# User should be in database
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: User still not in database
**Check:**
1. Database connection in `.env` is correct
2. Prisma schema is up to date: `npx prisma generate`
3. Database migrations applied: `npx prisma migrate dev`
4. No errors in server console
5. `/api/auth/sync` endpoint is working

### Issue: Clerk webhook not working
**Note:** Webhook is optional now with the fallback sync
**To enable webhook:**
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
3. Subscribe to events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
4. Copy webhook secret
5. Add to `.env`: `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."`

### Issue: Multiple sync calls
**This is normal** - UserSync prevents duplicates with state flag
First call creates user, subsequent calls return existing user

## Testing Commands

### Restart development server
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Clear test data
```bash
# If you need to clear test users:
npx prisma studio
# Delete test users from User table
```

### Check Prisma schema
```bash
npx prisma validate
npx prisma generate
```

## Files Changed

1. `.env` - Updated redirect URLs
2. `src/components/UserSync.tsx` - NEW: Fallback sync component
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added UserSync component

## Existing Files (Already Working)

1. `src/app/api/auth/sync/route.ts` - Sync endpoint with retry logic
2. `src/app/auth-callback/page.tsx` - Auth callback page
3. `src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts` - Clerk webhook handler

## Success Indicators

✅ User signs up → redirected to auth-callback → redirected to dashboard
✅ Console shows "✅ User synced to database"
✅ User appears in database with correct data
✅ User can use all features (upload PDFs, chat, etc.)
✅ Sign in works for existing users
✅ No duplicate user entries
